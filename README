This is a little sudoku solver/generator in C made around the end of 2015

You need visual studio installed to compile with build.bat (but it should be easy to get to build in other compilers),
The only thing that you probably need is to increase the stack memory. Otherwise you will get buffer overflows.

I guess this is on the public domain, you can do whatever you want with this. I did not take anything from anyone or anywhere in this release. 
Please don't sue me.
